```bash
# Initialize
npm run setup # Will randomly generate admin account password info, stored in data/init.json

# Start service
npm run service:start:daemon   # Run in background (recommended)

# Check status
npm run service:status
```

---

## 🎮 Getting Started

### 1. Open Management Interface

Browser visit: `http://your-server-IP:3000/web`

Default admin account: Look in data/init.json

### 2. Add Claude Account

This step is quite important, requires OAuth authorization:

1. Click "Claude Accounts" tab
2. If you're worried about multiple accounts sharing 1 IP getting banned, you can optionally set a static proxy IP
3. Click "Add Account"
4. Click "Generate Authorization Link", will open a new page
5. Complete Claude login and authorization in the new page
6. Copy the returned Authorization Code
7. Paste to page to complete addition

**Note**: If you're in China, this step may require VPN.

### 3. Create API Key

Assign a key to each user:

1. Click "API Keys" tab
2. Click "Create New Key"
3. Give the key a name, like "Zhang San's Key"
4. Set usage limits (optional)
5. Save, note down the generated key

### 4. Start Using Claude Code

Now you can replace the official API with your own service:

**Set environment variables:**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/" # Fill in your server's IP address or domain according to actual situation
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="API key created in the backend"
```

**Use claude:**

```bash
claude
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Reverse Proxy Deployment Guide

For production environments, it is recommended to use a reverse proxy for automatic HTTPS, security headers, and performance optimization. Two common solutions are provided below: **Caddy** and **Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)**.

---

## Caddy Solution

Caddy is a web server that automatically manages HTTPS certificates, with simple configuration and excellent performance, ideal for deployments without Docker environments.

**1. Install Caddy**

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caddy

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
sudo yum install yum-plugin-copr
sudo yum copr enable @caddy/caddy
sudo yum install caddy
```

**2. Caddy Configuration**

Edit `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:

```caddy
your-domain.com {
    # Reverse proxy to local service
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000 {
        # Support streaming responses or SSE
        flush_interval -1

        # Pass real IP
        header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
        header_up X-Forwarded-For {remote_host}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}

        # Long read/write timeout configuration
        transport http {
            read_timeout 300s
            write_timeout 300s
            dial_timeout 30s
        }
    }

    # Security headers
    header {
        Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
        X-Frame-Options "DENY"
        X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
        -Server
    }
}
```

**3. Start Caddy**

```bash
sudo caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
sudo systemctl start caddy
sudo systemctl enable caddy
sudo systemctl status caddy
```

**4. Service Configuration**

Since Caddy automatically manages HTTPS, you can restrict the service to listen locally only:

```javascript
// config/config.js
module.exports = {
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    host: '127.0.0.1' // Listen locally only
  }
}
```

**Caddy Features**

- 🔒 Automatic HTTPS with zero-configuration certificate management
- 🛡️ Secure default configuration with modern TLS suites
- ⚡ HTTP/2 and streaming support
- 🔧 Concise configuration files, easy to maintain

---

## Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) Solution

Nginx Proxy Manager manages reverse proxies and HTTPS certificates through a graphical interface, deployed as a Docker container.

**1. Create a New Proxy Host in NPM**

Configure the Details as follows:

| Item                  | Setting                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Domain Names          | relay.example.com            |
| Scheme                | http                         |
| Forward Hostname / IP | 192.168.0.1 (docker host IP) |
| Forward Port          | 3000                         |
| Block Common Exploits | ☑️                           |
| Websockets Support    | ❌ **Disable**               |
| Cache Assets          | ❌ **Disable**               |
| Access List           | Publicly Accessible          |

> Note:
>
> - Ensure Claude Relay Service **listens on `0.0.0.0`, container IP, or host IP** to allow NPM internal network connections.
> - **Websockets Support and Cache Assets must be disabled**, otherwise SSE / streaming responses will fail.

**2. Custom locations**

No content needed, keep it empty.

**3. SSL Settings**

- **SSL Certificate**: Request a new SSL Certificate (Let's Encrypt) or existing certificate
- ☑️ **Force SSL**
- ☑️ **HTTP/2 Support**
- ☑️ **HSTS Enabled**
- ☑️ **HSTS Subdomains**

**4. Advanced Configuration**

Add the following to Custom Nginx Configuration:

```nginx
# Pass real user IP
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

# Support WebSocket / SSE streaming
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
proxy_buffering off;

# Long connection / timeout settings (for AI chat streaming)
proxy_read_timeout 300s;
proxy_send_timeout 300s;
proxy_connect_timeout 30s;

# ---- Security Settings ----
# Strict HTTPS policy (HSTS)
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;

# Block clickjacking and content sniffing
add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;

# Referrer / Permissions restriction policies
add_header Referrer-Policy "no-referrer-when-downgrade" always;
add_header Permissions-Policy "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()" always;

# Hide server information (equivalent to Caddy's `-Server`)
proxy_hide_header Server;

# ---- Performance Tuning ----
# Disable proxy caching for real-time responses (SSE / Streaming)
proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
proxy_no_cache $http_upgrade;
proxy_request_buffering off;
```

**5. Launch and Verify**

- After saving, wait for NPM to automatically request Let's Encrypt certificate (if applicable).
- Check Proxy Host status in Dashboard to ensure it shows "Online".
- Visit `https://relay.example.com`, if the green lock icon appears, HTTPS is working properly.

**NPM Features**

- 🔒 Automatic certificate application and renewal
- 🔧 Graphical interface for easy multi-service management
- ⚡ Native HTTP/2 / HTTPS support
- 🚀 Ideal for Docker container deployments

---

Both solutions are suitable for production deployment. If you use a Docker environment, **Nginx Proxy Manager is more convenient**; if you want to keep software lightweight and automated, **Caddy is a better choice**.
